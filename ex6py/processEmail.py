def proEmail(email_contents, verbose=True):
    """
    Preprocesses the body of an email and returns a list of indices
    of the words contained in the email.

    Parameters
    ----------
    email_contents : str
        A string containing one email.

    verbose : bool
        If True, print the resulting email after processing.

    Returns
    -------
    word_indices : list
        A list of integers containing the index of each word in the
        email which is also present in the vocabulary.

    Instructions
    ------------
    Fill in this function to add the index of word to word_indices
    if it is in the vocabulary. At this point of the code, you have
    a stemmed word from the email in the variable word.
    You should look up word in the vocabulary list (vocabList).
    If a match exists, you should add the index of the word to the word_indices
    list. Concretely, if word = 'action', then you should
    look up the vocabulary list to find where in vocabList
    'action' appears. For example, if vocabList[18] =
    'action', then, you should add 18 to the word_indices
    vector (e.g., word_indices.append(18)).

    Notes
    -----
    - vocabList[idx] returns a the word with index idx in the vocabulary list.

    - vocabList.index(word) return index of word `word` in the vocabulary list.
      (A ValueError exception is raised if the word does not exist.)
